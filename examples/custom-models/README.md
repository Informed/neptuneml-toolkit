# Neptune ML Custom Model Examples

This folder contains end-to-end workflow examples for implementing and running custom models for Neptune ML for various use cases.

The notebooks are designed to be run on a [Neptune Jupyter notebook environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/graph-notebooks.html).
If you used the [Neptune ML quick start templates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/machine-learning.html#machine-learning-quick-start), then you will already have a Neptune Jupyter notebook environment.
Otherwise, see [the graph notebook package](https://github.com/aws/graph-notebook) for instructions on how to setup the neptune notebook on your local jupyter environment.
